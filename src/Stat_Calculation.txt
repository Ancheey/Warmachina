Stat calculation:

Item level = ilvl
Score = ilvl * 10

Either random or not split the score into pieces

VitalityScore = Score / x
LeftoverScore = Score - VitalityScore;

Stat = VitalityScore / VitalityWeight

if Stat % 1 > 0.5, round to upper

Armor is always calculated from the entire score.
if bonus armor is selected on an armor piece or a shield, it also is calculated from the entire score and added to armor without subtracting from the overall available score
if item is a shield, same goes for block value


Chances = (1 / Max(Level - 10, 1)) * Stat (0.05% per point at level 30)
